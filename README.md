# Ror
Coding is not an easy task. Itâ€™s frustrating, it challenges your mind. At the same time, it builds character and improves analytical thinking. Coding makes you **fierce**. It is with this fierceness that is honed among programmers in mind that the Ror programming language was designed.

Ror is an imperative, general-purpose language. It is designed to be usable across various fields for various kinds of applications. It features a robust set of data types, type checking, control structures, and anything else that might be expected of a modern programming language. To reduce the headache and frustration that comes with programming, readability, writability, and reliability were placed at the forefront over the course of designing the Ror programming language.

To be rewritten in another language.
